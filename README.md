# NameGenerator
Python 3.x fantasy name generation utilities

My own approach at fantasy name generation, based on "Themes" generated from loosely defined "Phonemes."

Here is an example of how to use it and an example of some potential output:

\>\>\> import namegen\
\>\>\> t = namegen.Theme()\
\>\>\> namegen.generate_name(t,4)\
'Ihauz'\
\>\>\> namegen.generate_dialogue(t)\
'Igigh awzaw awshauce! Bidge?'


I might expand on the functionality and better document my code in the future, but for now:
It is what it is. As such, I offer it as-is. :P
